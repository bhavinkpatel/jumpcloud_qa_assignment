* Initial questions, thoughts, to-dos, followups
   * How can you verify calls in curl?
      * Run commands with -v to see status codes
* Test Cases / AC
   * QUESTION: How long will the application wait for incoming connections? 
   * QUESTION: Does the application ever timeout?
   * QUESTION: Can you update the timeout value, if available?
   * QUESTION: If it does timeout, how so?
      * Does it shutdown entirely? 
      * Does it remain on, but reject all incoming requests? 
   * Application should respond to the specific port environment variable
   * Application should not respond to the specific port environment variable if passing a different port value
   * A Post to /hash in the correct format will return an identifier immediately
   * A Post to /hash will wait 5 seconds to compute the hash in SHA512 
      * This should be a timed request to ensure that it takes a total of 5 for the request to complete
   * What happens if you submit different forms of the password?
      * Valid
      * Invalid
      * ALL CAPS of the same password
   * What happens if you submit the same password?
   * The hashing algorithm should be in SHA512 
      * How to verify this?!
   * A Get to /hash should accept a valid identifier 
   * Submit a invalid identifier to GET /hash
   * Verify it is base64 encoded from an original POST
   * Get /stats
      * Can you attempt to submit data in the request
      * Total requests count
         * Check manually by tracking requests made
         * What requests are counted here?
      * Average time?
         * How to time requests?
         * Log each command > total > calculate average > verify 
      * Should return valid JSON format
   * Processing multiple requests?
      * How can you send multiple request in curl? 
   * No additional password requests should be allowed when shutdown is pending. 
      * Send shutdown, send new password 
      * Or send timed shutdown? Then send requests to verify? 
   * Does any other action/command trigger a request count +1
   * Is the total requests counting correctly
      * Any ways to manipulate that or try to break it? 
         * Many simultaneous requests - does it count correctly? Are each requests successful 
   * Does it count bad requests?
   * Can you update a password
   * Can you delete a password at /hash/x
   * Does sending the same password create a new identifier 
      * Camelcasing password
      * All caps
   * /1/2/3/4/5/6 in the url only returns the last indeifinter encoded password
      * This shouldn’t work? 
   * Authentication on the application?
      * Can you bypass it?
