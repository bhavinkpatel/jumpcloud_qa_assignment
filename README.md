# JumpCloud QA Assignment / Bhavin Patel / November 2021

### Submission Details
I opted to create each test scenario as its own issue. Each issue then has relevant details to run the scenario and supports comments to report on success or failure. The issue details also support labels, assignees and projects. I opted to create a kanban-style project to showcase the organization and flow of test scenarios. All newly created issues are automatically tagged in the To Do column. From here, you can either Pass or Fail the scenario, or if you feel further conversation is needed then a Follow Up column was also included.

I've also included an exploratory test planning file. This file is my 'test planning' as I was reading the assignment specifications and also testing the application side-by-side. This file is just thrown together thoughts and notes, which were then transferred to the Issues.
